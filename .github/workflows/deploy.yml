        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4 # Action specifically designed for deploying to GH Pages
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # GitHub's automatically provided token
          publish_dir: ./build # The directory that should be deployed (your SvelteKit build output)

                                  # But since you're using /docs on main, this might be simpler.
                                  # Alternative for /docs on main:
                                  # cname: 'your-custom-domain.com' # Optional if you have a custom domain
                                  # This action also automatically creates a .nojekyll file.
                                  # It has a mode to publish to the root of the main branch for user pages,
                                  # or to a docs folder. Let's use the simplest for project page:
                                  # Set the 'destination_dir' to 'docs' if you want it in the docs folder on main.
                                  # Default is to publish to gh-pages branch.
                                  # For your setup (docs folder on main):
                                  destination_dir: docs
